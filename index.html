                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I am currently enrolled as a Junior Full Stack Web Development student at Generation USA.
                My passion for technology started when playing video games as a child.
                I was fascinated by the ability of my console to render interactive 3d images to the screen.
                As I continue to see advances in gaming and technology, I am motivated to pursue a career in software engineering
                because I see it is the greatest known form of self expression and innovation. My strong points include creativity, persistence, and problem-solving.
                I am currently looking to progress my career by taking on a Junior Full Stack Web Developer position.</p>
